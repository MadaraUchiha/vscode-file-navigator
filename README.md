# file-navigator

File Navigator is a VSCode extension which enables simple file navigation through the VSCode menus, relative to the currently open file.

## Features

- Single command: open from the context menu or with the default key binding, `CTRL+L` (`CMD+L` on Mac)
- Fuzzy search files in the directory listing
- Select `..` to go to parent directory
- Great for navigating to hidden files and directories such as `.git/` and `node_modules/`
